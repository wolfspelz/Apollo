# Introduction

The project makes avatars and objects on Web pages. 

You have an avatar on every web page and you meet other people who are on the same page at the same time.

Our goal is to create a virtual world client similar to rocketon or weblin â€“ but better, richer, more important, more open for your participation, with an open source licence, and for all operating systems.

# Details

The Open Virtual World will be THE virtual world on the Web. It will be open just like the Web with millions of clients, and servers, and many services. We will create services for you and we hope, that other people will do the same. We believe, that competition makes this virtual world as interesting and diverse as the Web itself.

There will also be virtual items on web pages and in your inventory like this:

These items will appear on web pages. And you can interact with them.
